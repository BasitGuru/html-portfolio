<h1>The Best Movies According to myself</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>PK</h3>
<p>
  PK is an adventure which will make you laugh heartily, make you feel heart
  rended and make you learn to let go, simultaneously promulgating a message.
</p>
<h3>Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.</h3>
<p>
  This movie was terrific. The comedy caused rip-roaring laughter. Sanjay Dutt
  makes a comeback after his poor performance in Ek Aur Ek Gyarah. The emotional
  scenes are very poignant. The emotions and comedy have been integrated
  perfectly. The themes of the movie are very inspiring.

<h3>Dhamaal</h3>
<p>
  Truly Hilarious! 'Dhamaal' is a mad, zany, silly but truly hilarious comedy
  film, that hasn't lost its touch even after nearly a decade since its release.
  I have seen this cult-classic many times & the film only gets funnier each
  time I re-watch it.
